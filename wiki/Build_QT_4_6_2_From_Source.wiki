#summary This Page Mainly Talks About The Standard Process Of Building Qt 4.6.2 Binaries For Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 From Source Codes.

= Introduction =

 * Following describes a normal instruction on how to build Qt 4.6.2 for *Microsoft Visual C++ 2005* from Qt source codes.

 * *NOTICE 1:* If you want to use a BINARY VERSION of Qt 4.6.2, *SKIP* this document and turn to instructions on HOW TO use Qt 4.6.2 binaries.

 * *NOTICE 2:* This instruction *ONLY* demonstrates how to build *Qt 4.6.2 binaries for msvc2005*, which does not guarantee the same success on other Qt versions or compilers. Check [http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/installation.html] for details with other Qt versions or compilers.

 * *NOTICE 3:* If you are not skilled with Qt 4.6.2, carefully following this instruction is *MORE LIKELY* to have binaries successfully built.

== Preparations ==

=== 1. Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 ===

 * VC++ 2005 is the compiler we use to build Qt 4.6.2 binaries.

 * VC++ 2005 is among *COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS* which may require authentication of use.

=== 2. Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 SP1 ===

 * Better get VC++ 2005 patched with SP1 patch.

 * Visit [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/zh-cn/details.aspx?FamilyID=bb4a75ab-e2d4-4c96-b39d-37baf6b5b1dc Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 SP1] to acquire it.

=== 3. Qt 4.6.2 Source ===

 * The Qt 4.6.2 source needed for compilation.

 * See [http://code.google.com/p/academic-crawler/downloads/list SDK_01-Qt_4.6.2_src] to download.

=== 4. `VirtualBox` 4.0.2 ( *NOT NECESSARY, BUT RECOMMENDED* ) ===

 * *`VirtualBox` 4.0.2* is a virtual machine software.

 * The virtual machine may be the best place to build SDKs and test binaries.

 * `VirtualBox` 4.0.2 is a *OPEN-SOURCE* software.

 * `VirtaulBox` 4.0.2 can be acquired in "Downloads" section ( *NOT READY YET* ).

 * Visit [http://www.virtualbox.org] for more details about `VirtualBox`.
